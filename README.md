# WOCAL_DB

**Project Overview:**

![S1](imgs/overview.png)

Like most of us, when i'm working out i'm looking for results and improvement! I have tried many workout tracking apps online, yet i wanted one that was custom and tailored towards my needs; So instead, i created my own! This app works using the MongoDB collections i have setup to host my workout and calories statistics. What would be a workout application without being able to visualize your gains. I have included an option for linear regression amongst the weight and reps relationship to ensure i can get a full understanding of my improvements. In addition, this application allows me to view workout statistics and calorie(s) intake for a specific date, today's date, previous 7-days or even previous 30-days. This application has helped me take my workouts to the next level by ensuring I have access to these statistics at any given time. 

With this project I focused on utilizing Python Tkinter, matplotlib and pymongo libraries. By working on this project, I have gained a better understanding for MongoDB, making/pulling query results, and optimizing my code using branches.
